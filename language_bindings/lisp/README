Installation:

  Start your Lisp image in the audio-engine/language_bindings/lisp directory
  or add the latter to your ASDF registry:

    (push #p"/path/to/audio-engine/language_bindings_lisp/" asdf:*central-registry*)

  Don't forget the terminating slash.

  Then load with (asdf:load-system :audio-engine)

  You must call (audio-engine:load-library) once before you call any other function.
