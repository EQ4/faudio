Installation:

  Start your Lisp image in the audio-engine/language_bindings/lisp directory
  or add the latter to your ASDF registry:

    (push #p"/path/to/audio-engine/language_bindings_lisp/" asdf:*central-registry*)

  Don't forget the terminating slash.

  Then load with (asdf:load-system :audio-engine)

  You must call (audio-engine:load-library) once before you call any other function,
  or, equivalently, wrap all invocations in (audio-engine:with-library).
  
Backends:
  
  The audio-engine library can connect to the underlying C library using LispWorks FLI or CFFI.
  An appropriate backend will be selected automatically, see util.lisp for details.
