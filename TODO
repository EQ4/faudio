Only one audio stream
Multiple Midi streams OK

We will use the "big buffer" approach
    Everything is inline (or processors allocate intermediate themselves)

    Seq requires the max size of its children
    Par requires the sum size of its children
    Split requires its output size (ie its input*2)
    We implement frames as vectors (of max size) with padded 0
        Ie no reallocation is necessary if the vector size changes

    Problem: buffer_t is not dividable
        Change processor to accept void* instead of buffer_t ?
        Or fix SOS-acceptable way to divide a buffer_t       ?

==========
Additions

* Implement ringbuffer

* Implement non-realtime

* Implement realtime audio streams

* Implement realtime midi streams

* Implement priority queue

* Implement schedulers

* Specify Dynamic interface
    * Fix Dispatcher interface

* High-level Lisp bindings





==========
Misc issues

* Check if we can make Fluidsynth compile against checked in Glib
  binaries instead of /usr/local
  * Done?

* Come up with better way to include ASIOSDK in Portaudio (new
  submodule? nested?)

* Set visibility=hidden on OS X. See Apple documentation 'Dynamic
  Library Programming Topics'

* Update ScoreCleanerAudio/Resources/Info.plist, see Apple
  documentation 'Framework Programming Guide'

* Logging functions on OS X must create dir ~/Library/Logs/ScoreCleaner
  if not present

* DLL name and linkage on Windows
  * Still relevant?
