* Rewrite reserve_ptr in C++ style
  * Just a class, unreserve etc are methods

* Lifted function/processors in C++ can not handle tuples and lists, only vectors and raw types

* Remove non concept-checking code out of the /concept namespaces
  (These should be Boost Concept Check definitions ONLY, to make transition easier)

* Components_resolve should invoke cmake -D COMPONENTS_RESOLVED=1 to
  run the find... modules

* Check if we can make Fluidsynth compile against checked in Glib
  binaries instead of /usr/local
  * Done?

* Come up with better way to include ASIOSDK in Portaudio (new
  submodule? nested?)

* Set visibility=hidden on OS X. See Apple documentation 'Dynamic
  Library Programming Topics'

* Update ScoreCleanerAudio/Resources/Info.plist, see Apple
  documentation 'Framework Programming Guide'

* Logging functions on OS X must create dir ~/Library/Logs/ScoreCleaner
  if not present

* DLL name and linkage on Windows
  * Still relevant?
