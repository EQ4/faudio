* Sort out type class/interface idea (Eq, Num, Dynamic)

* Wrappers for bool/int/float (top implement Dynamic interface for messages)

* Ownership semantics for collections

* Add audio_type_t and time_t




* Check if we can make Fluidsynth compile against checked in Glib
  binaries instead of /usr/local
  * Done?

* Come up with better way to include ASIOSDK in Portaudio (new
  submodule? nested?)

* Set visibility=hidden on OS X. See Apple documentation 'Dynamic
  Library Programming Topics'

* Update ScoreCleanerAudio/Resources/Info.plist, see Apple
  documentation 'Framework Programming Guide'

* Logging functions on OS X must create dir ~/Library/Logs/ScoreCleaner
  if not present

* DLL name and linkage on Windows
  * Still relevant?
