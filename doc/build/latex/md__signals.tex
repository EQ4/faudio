The most important concepts in {\itshape faudio} are the notion of {\itshape signals} and {\itshape processors}. Both have simple definitions\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A {\itshape \hyperlink{group___fa_signal_gac5c72f160cd6e93a6783551627b166e5}{signal}} is a function of time, for example $ y(t)=sin(2\pi\,t) $.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A {\itshape processor} is a function from a signal to another signal.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Signals can be composed to create more complex signals.

While many signals can be described by simple formulas, other signals such as real-\/world audio recordings have no simple representation, and must be sampled to be handled by a computer. {\itshape faudio} hide this complexity by representing signals as opaque types. Thus signals are conceptually {\itshape continous} and have neither sample rate or duration.
