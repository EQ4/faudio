Build and install
=========================

Prerequisites
------------

This is a complete list of platforms, libraries and toolchains required to build the Audio Engine. For
the standard platforms, most dependencies are available as binaries on the DoReMIR package server. See
below for a step-by-step instruction on how to build.

### Platforms

Currently supported:

* Mac OS X 10.5 (32-bit)
* Windows XP or later (32-bit)

It should be relatively easy to port the Audio Engine to other platforms, provided that the required
libraries and tools are available (see below).

### Compilers

A compiler supporting C++0x (aka C++11 and C++11x) is required. Currently tested are:

  * clang 3.1   or later, using libc++ (Apple call this compiler "4.0.0 based of SVN 3.1")
  * GCC   4.6.2 or later, using libstdc++


### Libraries

#### Boost

The Boost libraries are required on all systems. The libraries we currently use are:

FIXME

On some system (notably MinGW) we additionally require Boost.Thread and Boost.Atomic. Other platforms use
C++0x standard library for atomic operations and threads. Note that Boost.Atomic is not part of the official
Boost distribution while Boost.Thread is.

#### Boost.Lockfree

Boost.Lockfree is required on all systems. It is not part of the official Boost distribution.

#### Portaudio

Required for real-time audio streams on all systems. Disable by setting `SCL_AUDIO_ENABLE_PORTAUDIO=0`.

#### Portmidi                                       

Required for real-time midi streams on all systems. Disable by setting `SCL_AUDIO_ENABLE_PORTMIDI=0`.

#### Fluidsynth

Required for using the Fluidsynth audio processor. Disable by setting `SCL_AUDIO_ENABLE_FLUIDSYNTH=0`.

#### Libsndfile

Required for non-real-time audio streams on all systems. Disable by setting `SCL_AUDIO_ENABLE_SNDFILE=0`.

#### System-specific code

The audio engine automatically include certain system headers on both OS X and Windows. You can control this exlicitly
by setting `SCL_AUDIO_ENABLE_OSX` or `SCL_AUDIO_ENABLE_WIN`.

#### Google Test (gtest)

Required for runnning the unit tests.
 


### Build tools

#### CMake

Required for building the libraries and binaries.

Supported generators are Unix makefiles and XCode on OS X, and MinGW or MSYS Makefiles on Windows. Cygwin might work,
but beware that the Cygwin/GCC compiler might not generate standard Windows binaries.

#### A Unix shell

Required for running certain build scripts, and for building language bindings and documentation. On Windows the
MinGW/MSYS shell is tested, but Cygwin might work as well.

#### Dist

Required for automatic package resolution. If you prefer to build packages locally, set `SCL_BUILD_PACKAGES=1`. In this
case Dist is not required.

#### Pandoc

Required for generating the reference manual (HTML or PDF).
  
#### Doxygen

Required for generating the detailed API documentation (HTML or PDF).



Step by step
----------

### Downloading the source code

The source code, as well as sources for the documentation and language bindings is stored in the repository
`audio-engine.git`. Its dependencies are stored in separate repositories which are linked into the main repository as
submodules. To fetch the source code for the audio engine and its dependencies, perform a recursive clone in Git:

    $ git clone --recursive git@git.doremir.com:repositories/audio-engine
    $ cd audio-engine

The last command will change your directory to the checked out repository. All following commands assume that you are
already in this directory.

### Setting up the build environment

    ./bootstrap
    make help

### Downloading dependencies

    make components_resolve

FIXME

### Building dependencies

    make edit_cache -DBUILD_COMPONENTS=1
    make components_resolve

FIXME                

Whenever possible, we try to build all dependencies as universal binaries containing static libraries for both 32 and
64-bit architectures. In some cases this is not possible, so we have to build 32 and 64-bit versions separately. We also
try to build everything locally, to avoid depending on the configuration of a particular system for the main build. You
may or may not have these libraries installed on your local system; this should not interfere with the build.

Note that some dependencies (i.e. Boost) are source only â€“ they do not require a separate build. Yet other dependencies
are included in the operating system.

### Building the audio engine

    make

### Testing the audio engine

    make test

    make run_scorecleaner

FIXME


### Building the language bindings

    make bindings

FIXME

### Building the documentation

    make documentation

FIXME

### Distributing the audio engine

    make distribute

FIXME


### Linking the audio engine into another application

By default, dynamic libraries are built. On Mac OS X this is a framework called ScoreCleanerAudio.framework and a dynamic
library called libsclaudio.dylib. They are different ways of packaging the same executable code. On Windows, a library
file named sclaudio.lib and a dynamic library file named sclaudio.dll is generated. You can load any of these
dynamically, using the appropriate system-specific API.
