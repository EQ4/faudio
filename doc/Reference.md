Reference
========

The ScoreCleaner Audio Engine supports cross-platform audio, midi and signal processing. It
may also be useful for other applications involving stream computation, although this is not
the main goal.

This document describes the Audio Engine in a language-neutral fashion, with some code examples
in Lisp and some in C++. For a detailed documentation, see the reference for the various APIs.
