@note
    This is an advanced topic, not necessary to read for general usage. On the other hand, you *should* probably read
    it if you want to modify or extend the Audio Engine.

The Audio Engine is specified using the [Modulo](https://github.com/hanshoglund/modulo) description language
and implemented in the [C99](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99) language.
