Introduction
========

The ScoreCleaner Audio Engine provides cross-platform audio, midi and signal processing. It
allows concurrent processing of audio and midi, as well as mixing of real-time and non-real-time
processing. It can be used by any language with C bindings. The core functionality is
implemented in C++.

This document describes the Audio Engine in a language-neutral fashion, with code examples
in Lisp. For a detailed documentation, see the reference for the various APIs.
