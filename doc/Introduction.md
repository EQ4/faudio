The DoReMIR Audio Engine provides real-time and non-real-time audio processing,
midi processing, as well as real-time scheduling and event handling. It is based on
high-level, semantically well-defiend concepts such as [signals][s],
[processors][p] and [events][ev].

The Audio Engine is specified in [Modulo][modlang] and implemented in [C][clang].
Bindings can be generated to any language supported by Modulo.
