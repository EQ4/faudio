Overview
==========

This page is a simple overview of the architecture and implementation of the audio engine.

The audio engine is implemented in C++ with bindings available for other languages. There is a C level API providing
wrapper functions for C++ methods and classes. This allow the C++ API to be consumed by any language that interfaces with
C.
