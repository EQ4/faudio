Some naming conventions
======

Imperative structures (buffer, queues etc) have param order
    Structure, Index, Data 
    
    to mimic arrays: S[I] = D
    
    i.e.
        get : (S,I) -> D
        set : (S,I,D) -> Void
        
Functional structures (lists, events, processors) have param order
    Values... Structure Structure
    
    to ephasize transformation
    
    i.e.
        cons : (V,L) -> L
        
Interfaces usually dispatch on their first argument
