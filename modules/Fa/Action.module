/** 
    Scheduling actions.
    
    The action types represent a single interaction with a running stream, such
    as a note or a control change.
    
    Actions can be *scheduled* on both real-time and non-real-time 
    devices: in the first case they are carried out when the internal clock of
    the stream reaches the scheduled time, in the latter case they are simply
    carried out at the appropriate time.
    
    For scheduling actions, see @ref fa_audio_schedule, @ref fa_midi_schedule
    or @ref fa_signal_run.

    @par Literals
    - `set`
    - `accum`
    - `send`

    @par Implements

    - fa_destroy_t
