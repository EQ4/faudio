=========================

For a basic build:
    
    $ ./bootstrap && make

This may require a network connection, as the ./bootstrap script may need to download
dependent libraries from the package server.

To run unit tests:

    $ make test
  
To test with ScoreCleaner (must be on the desktop, set $SCORECLEANER to override):

    $ make run_scorecleaner

To generate documentation:
    
    $ make doc

For more detailed instructions, see the documentation page Build and install.
